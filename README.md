# High Performance Computing 2022
### Raihaan Usman

This is my coursework submission! To get started, head to the CPP directory and run `make run{i}` for the i'th test case.

Alternatively for serial execution, run `make test{i}`.

Autogenerated Doxygen documentation and the technical report are available in the CPP/docs directory.

There is also an equivalent (but serial) Python implementation available for reference! (Uses Numpy for linear algebra)
